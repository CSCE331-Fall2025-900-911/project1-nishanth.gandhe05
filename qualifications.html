        <h2>About my Technical Skills & Interests</h2>
        <p>Howdy, I am currently a Computer Science student graduating in the class of 2027 with minors in AI in business and Statistics. Throughout my college career, I have taken classes in data structures and algorithms, discrete math, and multiple courses that taught me different programming languages, including C++, Java, and Haskell. Additionally, I have taken classes in computer architecture. Additionally, I have completed two internships, undertaken multiple personal projects, and currently serve as an officer for the Aggie Data Science Club. Through these experiences, I have developed various technical skills, including numerous frontend frameworks and backends, cybersecurity skills, proficiency in AWS, and expertise with different SQL databases. </p>
        <p>My technical areas of interest in Computer Science lie in three significant aspects: AI/ML, cybersecurity, and full-stack development. I have recently built multiple personal projects using ML, such as a cryptocurrency predictor, an F1 race simulator, and a song recommender for the members of ADSC. These projects sparked my curiosity to learn more about machine learning and pursue more technical knowledge on the subject. I also have an interest in AI that stemmed from my use of generative AI and my previous role at AI mastermind, where I played with multiple chatbots and tried to build my own trained models for various tasks. The reason I am interested in cybersecurity mainly comes from the fact that I am part of the cybersecurity apprenticeship program at Texas A&M and am currently a student technician working in the cybersecurity department. For them, I work to triage tickets and deal with the initial analysis of various threats found on the network. Finally, my interest in full-stack development has come from my experience at my previous two internships, where I worked as a full-stack software engineering intern. Additionally, I have created multiple websites and found it interesting to design and develop an entire website from scratch, as well as integrate the backend with the frontend.</p>
